Quagsire is a desktop application designed to assist players of the Pokémon minigame Voltorb Flip by solving the game board using a backtracking algorithm combined with entropy-based probability analysis. It helps players make informed decisions by calculating the likelihood of each cell being safe or a bomb, thus improving their chances to maximize points and minimize risks.

This project was originally developed as the final assignment for my Differential Equations subject during my Masters program. The final version implemented a combination of a logistic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and the Euler method to model the agent’s reliability progression based on the maximum entropy values on the board after each move that I developed myself.

The idea was to dynamically adjust the agent’s behavior as the game progressed, using the mathematical model to reflect increasing environmental complexity. However, for the final version presented here — aimed at a more practical and straightforward implementation — this feature was removed, as it was no longer considered a core element of the project.

The name was given after the fact that Quagsire was heavily used by Poké Nexus players who mined as a way to prevent Regice, Regirock and Registeel from exploding thanks to the Damp ability.
